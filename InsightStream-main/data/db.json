          "description": "Cyclone Ditwah swept northward across Sri Lanka on Friday, leaving 46 people dead and 23 missing amid widespread floods, with torrential rain and strong winds expected to cause more flooding in the next 12 hours.Most deaths were caused by landslides triggered by more than 300mm (12 inches) of rainfall in the eastern and central regions, according to officials.Nearly 44,000 people were affected nationwide, and many sought refuge in schools and public shelters, according to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC).The Irrigation Department said it expected the floods that have already affected countless areas across southern and eastern Sri Lanka, including many parts of the capital, Colombo, to spread even further.The Colombo Stock Exchange halted trading early, and schools and train services remained suspended. Military and police coordinated evacuations, including the airlifting of 13 people trapped on a bridge in Polonnaruwa, 220 km northeast of Colombo, the air force said.Numerous families trapped on rooftops and one man stranded on top of a coconut tree were also airlifted to safety, air force footage released to the media showed.Heavy rains disrupted operations at Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), forcing the diversion of 15 flights to airports including Trivandrum and Cochin in south India, Sri Lanka’s Airport and Aviation Services said.India delivered 6.5 metric tons of food aid to assist in relief efforts, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said as Cyclone Ditwah moved across Sri Lanka towards southern India.Over 20,000 police and military personnel stepped up evacuations in multiple towns, including the outskirts of Sri Lanka’s largest city, Colombo, after authorities warned of rising flood waters.“Strong winds are making the floods worse.We removed furniture from two nearby houses to a safer area, and now I’m going to the shelter to stay with the rest of my family,“ said Mohammed Rumy, a 70-year-old resident of Colombo’s Wellampitiya suburb.",
